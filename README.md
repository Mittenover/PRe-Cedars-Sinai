# PRe-Cedars-Sinai
This repository contains some of the codes I used during my research internship at Cedars-Sinai. 

The full_training.ipynb describe the algorithm of the full training of models with the hyperparameter optimization. With this code we are able to perform the training for a large number of adverse events.

The Training for corroboration.ipynb is the file used to train specific model and get the response associated in order to then perform the validation associated with this model.

The ttest.ipynb is the code I used to perform the t-test of the validation protocol.
